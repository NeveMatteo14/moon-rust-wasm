Excellent proposal!

Interesting project.  I've spoken to each of you individually about the project,
so I won't say much else here.

The scope is fine and you will probably have more than enough with the parser
and basic evaluator using `Rc<RevCell<LuaValue>>`.  You might consider including
some statistics gathering (such as using the `stats_alloc` crate as is done in
both Prog02 and Prog04b) so you can measure the effect that different changes in
representations have on your interpreter, even if they are limited to some
different choices in how to represent tables.


Score: 10/10
